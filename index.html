            <h2>Kills monsters</h2>
            <p> Witchers are like bounty hunters â€” they make a living by killing monsters. 
                Witchers were once humans, but through intense training and some kind of toxic exposure, become mutants of sorts, with superhuman strength and abilities</p>

            <h2>Silver Sword</h2>
            <p>One distinctive feature of Geralt's sword is its silver blade. The silver serves a specific purpose - combating monsters. In the world of The Witcher, 
                silver is known to be highly toxic to supernatural creatures, making it an essential element in Geralt's arsenal.</p>

            <h2>Protects Ciri</h2>
        <p>Geralt protects Cirila 
            because he is bound to her through the Law of Surprise. She is his Destiny, his Unexpected Child, someone bound to the witcher by Fate's most inextricably tangled fetters.</p>
